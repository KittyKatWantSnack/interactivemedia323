	<p>Far from the churchyard dig his grave, <br>
		On some green mound beside the wave; <br>
		To westward, sea and sky alone, <br>
		And sunsets. Put a mossy stone, <br>
		With mortal name and date, a harp <br>
		And bunch of wild flowers, carven sharp; <br> 
		Then leave it free to winds that blow, <br>
		And patient mosses creeping; slow, <br>
		And wandering wings, and footsteps rare <br>
		Of human creature pausing there.<br>
